  <p>Our movement stopped by <strong><u>COVID-19</u></strong> this year.
  <br>epidemic, pandemic, post-corona. The language that desease made, drove us in to the smallest room.
  <br>Lack of meetings and communications deepen our isolativity.
  <br>In that isolated land, Our movement ended up lost the direction.
  <br>After a year and half, we knew that we cannot stays like this forever.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-top:30px;">
    We are facing our reality that group of meeting cannot be like the past.
  <br>So we made ourselves a stage in our daily life.
  <br>We are going to show us that we are still connected in our each personal places.
  <br>As long as there is hope, as life goes on, the dance will goes on as well.
